# Barnsley-fern
 The fern is one of the basic examples of fractals. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales, and are created by repeating a simple process over and over in a loop. The Barnsley fern shows how graphically beautiful structures can be built from repetitive uses of mathematical formulas.
